    The LinkedList platform will enable users to create an account and a comprehensive profile that includes 
    information such as their educational background, profession, experience, and a brief biography. 
    Additionally, users will have the ability to create 'blog posts' highlighting their personal projects 
    and resumes. Once a post is published, it will be prominently displayed on the user's profile, allowing
    other platform users to view it. By providing a dedicated space for tech professionals to exhibit their 
    work and expertise, our platform aims to create opportunities for networking, collaboration, and career 
    growth.
